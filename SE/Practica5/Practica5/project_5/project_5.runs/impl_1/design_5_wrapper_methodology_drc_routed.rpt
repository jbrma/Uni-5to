2. REPORT DETAILS

TIMING-4#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock design_5_i/vga_0/U0/vga_v1_0_S00_AXIS_inst/display_image_inst/clk_ip_core_inst/inst/clk_ip_in is defined downstream of clock clk_out1_design_5_clk_wiz_1_0 and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#1 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out1_design_5_clk_wiz_1_0 and clk_ip_out_clk_ip_core_1 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out1_design_5_clk_wiz_1_0] -to [get_clocks clk_ip_out_clk_ip_core_1]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#1 Critical Warning
No common node between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out1_design_5_clk_wiz_1_0 and clk_ip_out_clk_ip_core_1 are related (timed together) but they have no common node. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out1_design_5_clk_wiz_1_0] -to [get_clocks clk_ip_out_clk_ip_core_1]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-27#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock on hierarchical pin  
A primary clock design_5_i/vga_0/U0/vga_v1_0_S00_AXIS_inst/display_image_inst/clk_ip_core_inst/inst/clk_ip_in is created on an inappropriate internal pin design_5_i/vga_0/U0/vga_v1_0_S00_AXIS_inst/display_image_inst/clk_ip_core_inst/inst/clk_ip_in. It is not recommended to create a primary clock on a hierarchical pin when its driver pin has a fanout connected to multiple clock pins
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell design_5_i/mdm_1/U0/MDM_Core_I1/JTAG_CONTROL_I/sel_n_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) design_5_i/mdm_1/U0/MDM_Core_I1/JTAG_CONTROL_I/sel_n_reg/PRE. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-9#1 Warning
Unknown CDC Logic  
One or more asynchronous Clock Domain Crossing has been detected between 2 clock domains through a set_false_path or a set_clock_groups or set_max_delay -datapath_only constraint but no double-registers logic synchronizer has been found on the side of the capture clock. It is recommended to run report_cdc for a complete and detailed CDC coverage. Please consider using XPM_CDC to avoid Critical severities
Related violations: <none>
